# Land-Cover-Classification-Using-Random-Forest
This study demonstrates a Random Forest (RF) workflow implemented in R to map land cover from multispectral satellite imagery. The analysis combines spectral bands (NIR, SWIR, RED) and NDVI (Rouse et al., 1973) as predictors with polygon training samples to produce a detailed, spatially explicit land cover map. Raster layers in GeoTIFF (.tif) format were aligned and resampled using terra (Hijmans, 2025), while training polygons from ESRI Shapefile (.shp) were transformed and centroids extracted with sf (Pebesma & Bivand, 2023). A Random Forest model with 500 trees (randomForest, Liaw & Wiener, 2002) was trained to classify the raster stack. 

The output was visualized with a custom color palette, north arrow, scale bar, and gridlines using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), tidyterra (Hernangómez, 2023), ggspatial (Dunnington, 2025), and scales (Wickham et al., 2025), and exported as a high-resolution PNG. This workflow demonstrates a reproducible, machine learning-driven approach to land cover mapping, integrating spectral indices, geospatial processing, and visualization entirely within R.
